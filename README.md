<b>JavaScript and DOM Manipulation

WAKE UP SHEEPLE! The extra-terrestrial menace has come to Earth and we here at ALIENS-R-REAL have collected all of the eye-witness reports we could to prove it! All we need to do now is put this information online for the world to see and then the matter will finally be put to rest.

We created a table dynamically based upon a dataset provided. Users can filter the table data for specific values. Pure JavaScript, HTML, and #CSS, and D3.js are used on our web pages. They are the only coding languages which can be trusted.
